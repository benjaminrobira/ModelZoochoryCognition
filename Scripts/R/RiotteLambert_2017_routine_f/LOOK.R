  ## this function performs all the steps to look for repeated sub-sequences in SEQ
 
  # SEQ is the movement sequence, i.e. a sequence of numbers representing the ordered visitation of different sites
  
  # if mutation_corr=TRUE, mutations are authorized given the rule : 10111, 11011, 11101 -> 11111,
    #  with "1" representing an identical site, "0" a different site.
  # if inserdel=TRUE, one insertion or deletion is authorized per sub-sequence that is more than L-site-long
  # the function performs a double check for repeated sub-sequences. This is necessary to avoid the under-estimation of the number of repetitions
  
  # the output repeated sub-sequences are at least 3-site-long and repeated at least 3 times
  
  # the outputs are :
          # groups : a list of vectors giving, for each repeated sub-sequence, all of its different repeated forms
          # Tocc : a list of matrices that give, for each repeated sub-sequence, the time indices of beginnings and endings of its occurrences
          # nrep : a matrix that gives for each repeated sub-sequence (specified in the first column) the number of times it is repeated (in the second column)
          # lineMAT_final : the raw information matrix on lines of 1s in the site-lag matrix (see help of the function infoLines for details)
